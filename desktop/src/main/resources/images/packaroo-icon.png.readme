# Packaroo Icon Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the Packaroo application icon.

For the actual application, you should place a proper PNG icon file here:
- File name: packaroo-icon.png
- Recommended size: 256x256 pixels or 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency support

The icon should represent the Packaroo application - perhaps a stylized box or packaging-related imagery that reflects the application's purpose of packaging Java applications.

You can create this icon using tools like:
- GIMP (free)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Canva
- Online icon generators

Until a proper icon is created, the application will handle the missing icon gracefully.
